# Task 6 ‚Äî Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

**Author:** Kush Thaker (kthaker442@gmail.com)  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate password-strength concepts by creating sample passwords of varying complexity, testing them with online checkers, and summarizing best practices.

---

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong, generate example passwords at different strength levels, test them using online password-strength tools, record results, and derive actionable tips for creating secure passwords.

---

## Tools (suggested)
- Password strength checkers: [passwordmeter.com], Bitwarden password strength tester, or any reputable online checker.  
- Local files in this repo:
  - `password.txt` ‚Äî contains example passwords used for demonstration.  
  - `Task6Report.pdf` ‚Äî full detailed report and practical test results.  
  - `images/` ‚Äî screenshots of the password checks and tests.

---

## Deliverables
1. **This README.md** ‚Äî summary and example passwords (this file).  
2. **password.txt** ‚Äî plain list of passwords used (for example/testing).  
3. **Task6Report.pdf** ‚Äî full, detailed report with methodology, test screenshots, and analysis (see main branch).  
4. **images/** ‚Äî screenshots of online tool output and any other evidence.

## How to test
1. Open an online password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com or Bitwarden).  
2. Copy one password from `password.txt` and paste it into the tool.  
3. Record the **score / percentage** and any feedback (e.g., ‚Äútoo short‚Äù, ‚Äúcommon pattern‚Äù, ‚Äúadd symbols‚Äù, ‚Äúuse more length‚Äù).  
4. Repeat for each example password.  
5. Save screenshots to `images/` and summarize results in your report (`Task6Report.pdf`).

## Suggested Result Table
| Password example       | Tool used      | Score (%) | Feedback from tool         | Notes (crackability estimate) |
|------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| kush123                | passwordmeter | 12        | Too short, common word     | Very weak ‚Äî dictionary attack  |
| Kush@123               | Bitwarden     | 45        | Add length, less predictable | Medium ‚Äî pattern-based risk    |
| Ku$hTh@k3r_2004!       | passwordmeter | 92        | Good length & complexity   | Strong ‚Äî high brute-force cost |

*(Fill this table with each test‚Äôs actual results and attach screenshots in `images/`.)*

## Key Findings
- **Length matters most:** Longer passwords (‚â•12 characters) drastically increase time-to-crack.  
- **Character variety reduces guessability:** Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
- **Avoid dictionary words & predictable substitutions:** Simple substitutions (`o`‚Üí`0`, `a`‚Üí`@`) are well-known to attackers.  
- **Randomness and non-personal content** improve security.  
- **Password managers** help generate and store high-entropy passwords safely.

---

## Best Practices
- Use a **passphrase** or a long random string (12+ characters recommended).  
- Mix character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols.  
- Avoid common words, repeated characters, or sequences.  
- Use a **password manager** to generate/store unique passwords for every site.  
- Change important passwords periodically and after any suspected compromise.  
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).
